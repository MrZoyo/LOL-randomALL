### New Multi-language support
- Add a new multi-language support system to support multiple languages. You can define the language in the `LANGUAGE` dictionary.

## V0.0.4 and before
- The play-style supported by this tool is the full random play-style that is currently hot on social media. 
- You can randomly select heroes, lines, summoner skills, runes, first builds, and you can also select the number of players (1 to 5).
- The hero list, build list and rune list are adapted to the latest LOL version. 
- When you choose to generate multiplayer results at the same time, each person's line will not be duplicated, and JUG will always have Smite.
- There is also a 2-1-2 no JUG mode available for easy use in vs-Bot mode.
